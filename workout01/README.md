Using data from select Golden State Warrior players, I produced "shot charts" graphs as a visual representation of shots made and attempted over the course of the 2016 season. All of the data preparation is for the final report on the five players (Iguodala, Green, Durant, Thompson, and Curry) regarding their shooting statistics, including their shot charts and their individual effective shooting percentages.
